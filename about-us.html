            <p style="font-size: large;" class="section-about-background-text">
                Recycle was born from a simple idea: to share the beauty of our town in a way that's both enjoyable
                and
                respectful of our environment. Our founders, [mention founder names if you have them], have always
                been
                avid cyclists and deeply connected to this community. Seeing the increasing need for sustainable
                tourism
                option, they envisioned a way for people to truly experience the town's charm without contributing
                to
                pollution or traffic congestion.
                <br>
                <br>

                We started with a small fleet of well-maintained bicycles and a passion for showcasing the hidden
                corners and historical landmarks that make our town special. Our guided tours are more than just a
                ride;
                they're an opportunity to learn, connect with the local culture, and appreciate the natural beauty
                around us.
                <br>
                <br>

                At Re-cycle, we believe that tourism can be a force for good. By choosing an eco-friendly way to
                explore, you're not only having a fantastic time but also contributing to a healthier band more
                sustainable future for our town. We're constantly looking for new ways to enhance out tours and
                further
                minimize our impact on the environment.

                Join us on a Re-cycle tour and become party our story!
